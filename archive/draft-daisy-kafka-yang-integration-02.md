## Abstract

With the introduction of YANG [RFC7950] as a data modelling language in the network for configuration and operational metrics, an automated onboarding of new models and metrics into a Data Mesh Big Data environment and therefore a closed loop operation without human intervention is at possible reach. YANG can be serialized in JSON [RFC8259], XML and CBOR [RFC7049]. With [RFC9254], YANG specific encoding rules for CBOR had been defined at IETF. 

A message broker enables real time data exchange among different Data Mesh domains. A schema registry ensure that the producer and consumer can learn from each other the schema and version for each message outband. Confluent [Apache Kafka] message broker supports custom data serialization. Since April 2020, Confluent extended their [Schema Registry] to be pluggable. Supporting besides AVRO (JSON and binary) also JSON and Protobuf natively. Described in [SR Blog Post], [SR Protobuf Provider Plugin], [Protobuf Serializer/Derializer], [Protobuf Serde for Kafka Streams] and [Protobuf Connect Converter].

With [draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif] and [draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif] two proposed standards at the NETCONF working group which supports configured YANG push subscriptions are in progress. [draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif] is aimed for exporting accounting metrics at scale without back pressure from YANG push receiver to publisher and supporting with [draft-ietf-netconf-distributed-notif] export directly from network processors. While [draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif] supports back pressure and therefore works well for state changes.

[draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif] supports YANG push notification messages according to [RFC8639] and application/yang-data+json and application/yang-data+xml [Media Types] for encoding. [draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif], supports YANG push notification messages according to [RFC8641] and application/yang-data+json, application/yang-data+xml and application/yang-data+cbor for encoding.

The YANG push notification message described in [RFC8641] contains a subscription id for each message as metadata. Referencing the subscribed XPath, a subsection of a YANG module. The YANG subscription id is being defined when a new XPath is subscribed to. Without this metadata, the YANG push receiver (YANG push data-collection) is unable to determine which YANG module matches the JSON/XML/CBOR encoded message today.

With [draft-ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] YANG versioning requirements have been defined and with [draft-ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] a YANG versioning handling has been proposed. This needs to be carried on to YANG push into the notification header [draft-tgraf-netconf-yang-notifications-versioning] and also into the YANG push subscription [RFC8641].

An [Apache Kafka] topic supports multiple subjects. Each subject maps to a dedicated schema id in the schema registry [Schema Registry Overview]. A YANG push receiver IPv4/6 address and L4 port maps 1:1 to an Apache Kafka topic.

In this document we describe how Confluent's [Apache Kafka] data serialization and [Schema Registry], the native Confluent Kafka producer and consumer, the time series data base ingestion and the [pmacct] pmtelemetryd YANG push receiver needs to be extended to enable automated data onboarding while preserving the data semantic along the chain.

## Aim

With the establishment of a bounded context (standardized interface) between operational metrics and analytical application, we meet the following project goals

* New YANG push metrics are visible in the time series database within minutes without manual intervention
* New analytics components, regardless which network or analytics vendor provides if, can be integrated seamlessly
* Enabling a digital twin for a closed loop operated network


## Status of this memo

Project Kickoff at IETF 115 in London.


## YANG push receiver

The [pmacct] YANG push receiver needs to be extended to read

* From YANG push notification header, the YANG XPath and version as specified in [draft-tgraf-netconf-yang-notifications-versioning]
* From YANG push notification header, the subscription id as specified in Section 3.6 of [RFC8641]
* From the JSON payload, the vendor specific sensor-path metadata

by developing a new libyangpush library and integrate it into [pmacct].

To determine which YANG module and version for the JSON/CBOR payload in the YANG push notification message.

If for that YANG module and version the Confluent schema ID is not cached yet, then a <get-schema> NETCONF request as defined in section 3.1 of [RFC6022] by leveraging the [libnetconf2] library needs to be performed to the IPv4/6 address where the YANG push message is being originated from to obtain the YANG schema. Once obtained, the YANG schema needs to be posted through a REST API to the Confluent Schema Registry [Schema Registry] and the Confluent Schema ID in return needs to be used for Kafka serialization with [libserdes].

At present it is unclear, when CBOR encoding is performed at the YANG push publisher, wherever the notification message described in RFC 8641 is being encoded in CBOR or remain JSON encoded. When CBOR encoding is performed at YANG push publisher and the notification message would be encoded in CBOR as well, the YANG push receiver would need to deserialize the message to determine the YANG XPath and version. For this purpose, the [libcbor] library could be used.

This activity is planned as part of a [YANG push Data Collection integration Internship] with Zhuoyao Lin from the Institut Polytechnique de Paris.


## YANG schema registry

The pluggable Confluent [Schema Registry] needs to be extended to support YANG [RFC7950]. This enables schema evolution between Kafka producer and consumer and automated data ingestion into a timeseries database at a consumer.

In order to support YANG [RFC7950] the following items need to be defined and developed

* Which [Confluent Compatibility Checks] defined in section 11 [RFC7950] should be performed for different [Confluent Compatibility Types]
* How YANG yang-version statement, namespace statement, prefix statement and the revision-statements are preserved and revision-statements possibily being used in the [Confluent Compatibility Checks]


## YANG Kafka producer/consumer

The JSON message, including the notification message header specified in section 2.6 of [RFC8639], and the YANG push header specified in section 3.7 and figure 9 under section 4.1 of [RFC8641] needs to be serialized with the Confluent Schema ID. It needs to be determined if the same [AVRO Wire Format] should be used. When being consumed from a Kafka topic, the Confluent schema ID needs to be read and a REST HTTP GET call to the Confluent Schema Registry needs to be performed.

The changes should be developed first to the native JAVA Kafka producer/consumer and then to [libserdes] second.


## YANG push subscription

The YANG push subscription process for a network node needs to be extended with the YANG version. During the subscription process the subscription id is obtained for each XPath and version and all stored in a mapping file for use at the YANG push receiver when YANG XPath and version is not present in the YANG push notification header yet.


## YANG Times Series Data Base Ingestion

The schema from the schema registry is being used to define the times series database schema and the ingestion rule for the operational metrics. The time when the message was being produced by the YANG publisher can be optionally obtained by the <eventTime> as defined in section 4 of [RFC5277]. The subscription id and in the future also the observation domain id, the XPath and the version can be obtained from the YANG push schema specified in section 3.7 and figure 9 under section 4.1 of [RFC8641].
